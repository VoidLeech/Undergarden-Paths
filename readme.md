## Undergarden Paths Repathed
An addon to the Undergarden that adds paths for the dimension's respective dirt/turf types.

### Purpose
This is a fork of [Xaidee's Undergarden Paths](https://github.com/Xaidee/Undergarden-Paths), bringing the mod to newer versions of Minecraft. I have submitted the ports as PRs to the original, but have not had a response yet.
I wanted to add compatibility for this mod to one of my other projects, and because I want to publish make that compatibility available to the general public, I'll be publishing the ports (and only the ports).
The published versions are of these 1.20.x-repathed branches. If at any point the PRs are merged, the published projects will be archived.

### Differences from the original:
- Ported to Neoforge 1.20.1, 1.20.4, and 1.20.6.
- Made mods.toml issue tracker point to this fork.
- Added myself to authors to reflect the work done in porting the mod.
- Re-ran datagen to make sure port succeeded in that regard.
- Updated .gitignore for neoforge's runs directory
