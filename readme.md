## Undergarden Paths Repathed
An addon to the Undergarden that adds paths for the dimension's respective dirt/turf types.

### ~~No~~ Purpose
This is a fork of [Xaidee's Undergarden Paths](https://github.com/Xaidee/Undergarden-Paths), bringing the mod to newer versions of Minecraft. I had submitted the ports as PRs to the original, hadn't had a response for quite a while (the notifications were just missed, and I should have tried to communicate more after the PRs were submitted, before resorting to releasing as repathed).
I wanted to add compatibility for this mod to one of my other projects, and because I wanted to make that compatibility available to the general public, I published the ports (and only the ports).
On curseforge, these files have now been archived as the original project will update.
On modrinth, I was quick enough with reaching out to the moderators to withhold publishing the project entirely.
So barring the 21 CF downloads we should see maximal traffic to pages of the mod's author (:

---
I tend to keep around my forks of projects I contributed to, and will do so here, but the main branch will switch away from repathed again.

### Differences from the original:
- Ported to Neoforge 1.20.1, 1.20.4, and 1.20.6. 
- Made mods.toml issue tracker point to this fork.
- Added myself to authors to reflect the work done in porting the mod.
- Re-ran datagen to make sure port succeeded in that regard.
- Updated .gitignore for neoforge's runs directory
